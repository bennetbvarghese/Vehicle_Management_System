# Vehicle_Management_System
Project Grade 12 Computer Science / Informatics Practices


This project mainly uses Python as frontend and MySQL as backend.


This project is a connection between mysql and python


There are 3 programs in this project:

Main.py 

Admin.py

Cust.py

The main program is in Main.py

The other 2 python files are imported to the main program.

The Admin.py program can :

insert

update

delete 

values in mysql using python.

The cust.py can only select their choice.
They cannot edit any values in the database.

This program is based on mysql connectivity

For this to work prefectly there should be a module named  'mysql.connector'

if not avaiable
please download from command prompt using the command 


pip install mysql-connector


I can assure you that if all the modules are there and it works prefectly 

Then there will we no red mark in your python shell ,

There will be no error message in the program.


Thank You...😃😃
